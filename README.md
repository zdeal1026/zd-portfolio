# Purpose
This project focused on using tools we learned to create a Portfolio webpage. The purpose of this project was to start honing our skills to create advanced web pages. We were able to add alot of style to this page by using CSS attributes. The challenge was finding the path for whichever item you wanted to change. 

*Addendum*

This is the second version of my portfolio. I was able to use more techniques to make it looked more "polished". I used some new CSS tricks to make it look better and adjusted the color to make it easier on the eyes. I also added a background image and fixed it to a position so that it wouldn't scroll with the portfolio information. I updated my projects and my skill set. I am looking forward to continue adding to my skill sets and can't wait to see what it looks like when I update it the next time. I also added a resume for users to download and personalized my Github page!

*Addendum*

Third times the Charm!! This assignment was just another portfolio update. It feels great looking at the skills I've learned. As of now, the back end of coding has really got my attention. It seems more challenging but feels so much rewarding when you get an application to work. I look forward to trying to find a job and mastering my skill set!

# Criteria
1. Previous work on Portfolio Page.
2. Has candidate name, photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and contact information.
3. Anchor links created within the Page.
4. Anchor links to titles images of applications
5. First application must be larger in size than others.
6. When Images are clicked you are directed to the deployed application.
7. The web page has a responsive layout.


# Notes
This was fairly challenging for a first time coder. I am looking forward to coming back and reworking this webpage in the future. It will be exciting to see what new skills I can add next time!
