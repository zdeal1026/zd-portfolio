# Purpose
This project focused on using tools we learned to create a Portfolio webpage. The purpose of this project was to start honing our skills to create advanced web pages. We were able to add alot of style to this page by using CSS attributes. The challenge was finding the path for whichever item you wanted to change. 

# Criteria
1. Previous work on Portfolio Page.
2. Has candidate name, photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and contact information.
3. Anchor links created within the Page.
4. Anchor links to titles images of applications
5. First application must be larger in size than others.
6. When Images are clicked you are directed to the deployed application.
7. The web page has a responsive layout.


# Notes
This was fairly challenging for a first time coder. I am looking forward to coming back and reworking this webpage in the future. It will be exciting to see what new skills I can add next time!
